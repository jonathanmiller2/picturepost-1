          <P>This is one of the original picture posts built by John Pickle. Located in Menotomy Rock Park in Arlington, MA, it was built using plywood and varnished to withstand weathering. But even so, John has replaced these with the plastic lumber tops.</P>

         <P>This is a plastic lumber post top placed by Annette Schloss on the corner of her backyard deck. The top was not attached but brought inside in between picture takings. Sadly, after a year of pictures, the deck was replaced with a room addition to the house. A new post was added!
