                     <P>Our post tops are being manufactured by students at  the Richard W. Creteau Regional Technology Center, Spaulding High School, in Rochester NH. Students get hands-on experience working on real life problems, and we get newly designed post tops that better accomodate smart phone cameras. We are excited to collaborate with the students and their instructors on our project.</P>
<P>Picture post tops are available for<strong> $35 </strong>each. Please add <strong>$5</strong> for every 2 tops for handling and postage in the United States. (Add $5 for 1 or 2 tops; $10 for 3 or 4 tops, and so on.) International orders will have additional postage, to be determined per order.

<h2 align=left>Tips</h2>
                      <UL>
                        <LI>Plastic lumber lasts for decades and requires no maintenance. Our platforms (as shown at the right) are etched with &quot;N&quot; for North (follow the installation instructions below to find True North) to help when positioning the post and can be used as a starting point for taking pictures.
                        <LI>Consider attaching the platform to existing structures, such as interpretive signs (as in parks or nature centers) or on a fence or deck post.
