	<font size="5"><b><a name="Forums"></a>Introduction to the Forums</b></font><br /> 
	<br /> 
	The goal of the Picture Post Forums is to promote enjoyment and stewardship of the outdoors through picture post activities. It is an open forum for discussing all aspects of taking repeat digital photographs, analyzing data, monitoring the outdoor environment, educating the public about environmental change, and general citizen science efforts.  <br /> 
	<br /> 
	The forum guidelines for posting are important and should be read and accepted before you choose to participate. Picture Post encourages contributors who are courteous, polite and respectful. We discourage those who choose to behave in a disrespectful and/or irresponsible manner. Picture Post, its staff and volunteer moderators will take appropriate steps to ensure discussions adhere to these guidelines.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	If you have any questions regarding the appropriateness of a forum discussion post that you have read, you can use the 'report' icon found at the bottom of that post. This alerts a Picture Post Forum Moderator to look into that topic. You may also contact the author of the post, citing the appropriate section of the forum guidelines. Be respectful.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	Discussion forums are moderated to preserve the spirit of an open, interactive discussion without offending participants. Please understand that we are not attempting to censor any messages or opinions. <br /> 
	<br /> 
	<b><font size="5">Forum Guidelines </font></b><br /> 
	<br /> 
	1. To post in the Picture Post Discussion Forums, you must be 18 years or older, or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	2. Forum courtesy:  Please treat Picture Post, its employees, volunteers, fellow community members, and guests in these forums with courtesy and respect. Whether a community member has one post or many posts, everyone should be treated respectfully.  <br /> 
	<br /> 
	3.  Foul language and obscene images will not be tolerated. This site is family-friendly.  All forum posts must conform to a family-friendly standard and contributors must act accordingly. It is not appropriate to replace characters in a profane word to elude the built-in censoring filter, or forum moderation.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	4. Personal attacks and inflammatory or antagonistic behavior will not be tolerated. If you want to post criticism, please do so constructively. Generalized, vicious or veiled attacks on a person or idea will not be tolerated. <br /> 
	<br /> 
	5. Sock puppet accounts are not permitted. A sock-puppet account is created and used by a person who already has a primary account, for the purpose of posting anonymously. Posts from known sock puppet accounts may be deleted, and both the sock-puppet and primary accounts may be suspended from the Picture Post sites. Please use your real, primary account for posting in the Picture Post forums.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	6. Keep on topic: Responses to a particular thread should stay on-topic and pertain to the discussion. Users should use the New Topic button to start a new discussion which would otherwise be off-topic in the current thread. Threads that veer off topic may be redirected, closed or moderated by a moderator.  Deliberate disruption or derailing of topics is not appropriate. However, our moderators allow for natural progressions of topics.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	7. Private discussions: Sometimes, a discussion thread strays off into a friendly dialogue or a heated debate among a very small number of users. For these exchanges, we ask that you please use the Private Message feature that is provided through the Picture Post forums. Public forum posts should be reserved for matters of interest to the general Picture Post community.  <br /> 
	<br /> 
	8. Spam: Posting the same message, or an unsolicited commercial message, to one or many topics or boards is considered spamming and may result in a restriction on future forum posting privileges. Duplicate messages may be deleted or consolidated by our moderators. Please do your best to post new topics to the appropriate forum board. Moderators can take action when a thread should be moved to a more appropriate section. <br /> 
	<br /> 
	9.  Commerciality and postings with a larger agenda: We will limit forum discussions that promote commercial, social, political or charitable agendas as well as those which do not reasonably relate to the activity of the Picture Post Network. <br /> 
	<br /> 
	Threads or posts perceived to have been made with the intent of promoting any of the above agendas will not be permitted. Please note that our Volunteer Forum Moderators are authorized to exercise their discretion in providing some reasonable latitude for forum discussion postings relating to local events and issues in local discussion forums. Notwithstanding the above, Picture Post reserves the right to include or permit the inclusion of limited commercial content in this forum, at its sole discretion.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	10. We generally do not allow surveys to be conducted in the Picture Post forums.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	11. Any messages you post in these discussion forums will remain available to the public for as long as this discussion forum is online; please post carefully and with due consideration to the content of your post. An exception is if the post does not meet forum guidelines and is moderated. Moderated posts may be removed or edited by moderators or Picture Post. In the unlikely event that we do edit your post and you do not like the changes, we can delete the message at your request.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	12. If someone has posted copyrighted material or otherwise illegal material, please notify Picture Post so that we may take appropriate action, or report the content using the 'report' icon at the bottom of the post. Owners of copyrighted materials will be required to submit a copyright claim in accordance with the Picture Post Terms of Service Agreement, Claims of Copyright Infringement section 11. <br /> 
	<br /> 
	13. Abuse of this forum will not be tolerated.<br /> 
	<br /> 
	Additional Terms: The Picture Post Forums are further governed by the above Picture Post TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT</a>, the terms of which are hereby incorporated into these guidelines by reference.
