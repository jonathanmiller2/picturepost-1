    Signage is the best way to let people know that there is a Picture Post in the area, its purpose, and how and where to upload pictures. Attractive and informative signs go a long way towards inviting people to take pictures now or to bring along their digital camera next time! Signs can be attached to the post and anywhere else that will point people to your post.</P>

                        <LI>If your Picture Post is in a park or along a trail, ask the park personnel if you can put a sign about the post in their kiosk or bulletin board.
                        <LI>Signs should be laminated and attached securely to the post to resist being lost or damaged by weather and becoming unreadable. 
                        <LI>Include the Picture Post logo on your signs -- the more Picture Posts that pop up around the world, the more visible is the network, and the more information that is collected.                                                
                        <LI>Once you have added your post to the website, it will be assigned a post number and a permanent URL. You can include the post URL in the signs for people to easily find your post on the website.
